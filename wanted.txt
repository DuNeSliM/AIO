I want to create an windwos application with tauri as frontend and a Go backend, it should have the same functions as Playnite(look in the Playnite folder) but also has a shop with a wishlist, search, filter functions, and that it searches all game stores: steam, epic games, gog, amazon games, xbox, battlenet, uplay. Also my bibliothek should be automatically be imported by linking my accounts of those stores with my account of this new app, like in playnite i can login wiht steam, epic etc. in this new app. can you create the backend for it?
